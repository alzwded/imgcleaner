you can have something like
      PROGRAM P
      INTEGER A(3), I
      DO 10 I = 1,3
        A(I) = I
   10 CONTINUE
      SUB(A(2:3))
      STOP
      END

      SUBROUTINE SUB(A)
      INTEGER A(2)
C     will print 3
      WRITE (*, *) A(2)
      RETURN
      END

also: something about A(:) to receive slices?
maybe A(leadingsize, *) ?
maybe A(*)?
